 My LG G3 was smashed and died, so I bought a used replacement online with the intention of restoring my TWRP backup to it. Idiotically, I ended up restoring the EFS partition of the old dead phone along with everything else. Now the IMEI is blank and the phone has no signal. Is there any possible way of writing the IMEI? I have tried 'EFS professional' and 'QPST', and no luck. Quite possibly I'm being an idiot. Has anybody attempted this and is there any good guide out there for the G3 speci. · -1.

Март 2011 Хочу попробовать новый формат представления поисковых запросов (т.е. по возможности, попробую дать ответы). I know i should've backed up everything before flashing but whats done is done!

Hi everyone, So i bought an iPhone SE 128GB and tried to get it hooked up to my existing line, but when i would load it after inserting the correct SIM card it would briefly show a connection but then i continuously got "No Service". After a few hours of troubleshooting with a representative I have left my current phone on the line. I checked the IMEI number for compatibility on the sprint website and made sure that it was the correct model number to get all the bands (a1723). Upon further. Title. I wanted to use my 6S for next time I go to the states since I bought a T-Mobile roaming package so I don't have to swap SIMs in my iPhone 8+ and switch numbers, but it says SIM Not Supported when i put in the T-Mobile SIM. Said SIM works just fine on my iPhone 8. So, I tried my Canadian SIM in the 6S and that said unsupported too. Phone used to work fine on a Bell SIM(another canadian telecom). Contacted Bell and they say that the device isn't locked to their network. What could. 
I have an iPhone X that was unlocked by AT&T but is not working with Verizon. Can someone. I had recently updated my moto g5 plus phone potter version xt1687 to oreo with the september OTA update( i downloaded the update with cellular data) and when i did the imei was set to zero i updated it again with wifi to october security update but nothing happened. After looking throughout the web and trying various methods such as : Downloading pixel experience to get imei, downloading stock rom to get IMEI, and using persist fix from online. None of these has worked. Could anyone Does anyone know what's the exact process of unlocking a iphone xs / max purchased from tmobile? I filed for an international traveler's exception to get my iphone xs unlocked, and already got the confirmation email from them stating that it will be unlocked within 24hr. To my past experience that 24hr usually only means not more than 3 hour, but I still can't get a sim from oversea to work in the iphone. Keep getting sim not supported message. What caught my attention was that iphone I recently replaced the screen on my zenfone 2 and the proximity sensor isnt working. Decided to make a nandroid of my lineage/nutos build, wipe and restore using ASUS tool back to stock to run the diagnostics application (hidden in calculator app). That proved the proximity sensor is broken/missing, but when i restored the nandroid from TWRP, i have no SIM functionality (Baseband unknown). I then reset using the ASUS tool again and sim functionality is back. What do i have to do to restore. 
I'm on free year BYOD plan(verizon iphone 6s plus), after traveling back from Bahamas where international roaming worked perfectly, I got no service on my phone. Went through numerous tech support with reset network settings, ##25327#, ##873283# and tried a new sim card, issue still persists. Finally, one tech support mentioned this is a known issue with 6s plus. My question is anyone has any insights and also if my phone won't work with sprint anymore, will it work with other carriers? Simple as that. It's completely wiped, the only info we have are the IMEI and serial numbers. Looks like it may have been lost or stolen at one point, and somebody tried to restore it. IMEI isn't blacklisted, and would be cool to return it to the owner even tho based off the info I have on the phone it's been lost for around 3 years. I'm aware that this phone isn't worth a whole lot, but for some reason I've taken it on as a challenge to find the legitimate owner. Think we could return https://imgur.com/jfyHRjq. I had a Samsung GT-i9300 with imei damaged (it was using rom stock), then I installed LOS and the device still had the same imei (0049. /01). Now, I paid for a service and the phone is working well, with rom stock. I want to install LOS im that device. Is there any risk that imei would crash again? Edit: I have never had this problem in my g2m. This is a samsung issue. There is this error in TWRP when I try to restore my backup from PC: https://imgur.com/jfyHRjq Is it possible to fix it, or the only solution is to buy a new motherboard. I have an LG V20 smartphone. Was working fine before I went to bed last night. Woke up to find that the device was unable to read the two sim cards I have in there. Tried to do a factory reset, got stuck on "Updating Firmware, looking for any connection" twice. Rebooted on safe mode. From there, I thought I would just update the firmware as I usually do and everything would be great and I would have this wonderful working phone back in my life again and I would have everything I ever wanted. 
Hi, I have a Samsung s3 lineage os 7.1.2, it has imei corrupted and I'm having trouble to get signals, pls guys tell Me any solution so I can recover my imei  Thanks and regards. After a failed root attempt on my Galaxy Note 5 I have lost network capabilities; there is no baseband and imei. The phone was working perfectly until the root attempt-- which was made by flashing a file named "Noble-Kernel-N920L_Alpha1.tar" which caused a "Kernel is not Seandroid Enforcing" error and temporarily bricked the phone. After some googling I was able to fix the bricked phone, but the network problem started to occur at this point. I've since been able to successfully I recently bought a Redmi Note 4 (Global) which was sold by one of our carriers here in South Africa. Now the problem is they don't like selling dual sim phones so they disabled the second sim slot somehow. My sim tray can take two sims but sim 2 (the nano sim) doesnt get detected and theres also no option in sim management for it. I have updated it to the latest MIUI by putting the rom on the phone and updating via Updater, but that didn't seem to solve it. I tried unlocking the bootlo.
